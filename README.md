# MixTaper

MixTaper is a song playlist building and sharing platform that helps music lovers keep track of and organize all the music they are currently listening to. Users can create playlists using MixTaper’s search feature, which leverages the Spotify API to find songs. MixTaper makes it easy to add more songs to playlists and drag and drop songs to change the order of the playlist. Users can also browse other users’ playlists and subscribe to their playlists. Once subscribed, these playlists will appear on the User’s profile page for easy access.
